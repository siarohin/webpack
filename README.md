# DemoApp

DemoApp is a sample web App based on Webpack v4 builder. It is a pure Vanilla JS project, without any back-end.

## Install

Run `npm run install` to install dependencies.

## Local dev

After `npm run start`, webpack-dev-server will be opened at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Build for production

Run `npm run build`, so webpack builds app at `/dist`.

## ESLint

Update `.eslintrc.js` for changing installed rules.
